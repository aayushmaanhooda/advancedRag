This is Step 3 of RAG - storing and efficiently searching through millions of embeddings.

4How Vector Databases Work

Core Concept: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) SearchInstead of checking every vector, 
                use smart algorithms to find approximately the closest vectors.

Tradeoff:

Exact search: 100% accurate, but slow
ANN search: 95-99% accurate, but 100x faster!

Common ANN Algorithms:
1. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
2. IVF (Inverted File Index)
            How it works:
    ```
        1. Cluster all vectors into groups (using k-means)

        Cluster 1: [vectors about Python]
        Cluster 2: [vectors about Java]
        Cluster 3: [vectors about databases]
        ...

        2. When searching:
        - Find which clusters are closest to query
        - Only search within those clusters!
        - Ignore other clusters
    ```

3. LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)
        How it works:
        
        Hash similar vectors to the same bucket:

        hash("Python programming") → Bucket #42
        hash("Coding in Python")   → Bucket #42  ← Same bucket!
        hash("I love pizza")       → Bucket #78  ← Different bucket


Key Vector Store Concepts

Concept 1: Indexing vs Querying
Concept 2: Metadata Filtering - Combine vector search with metadata filters
Concept 3: Sharding / Partitioning
Concept 4: Quantization (Compression)
Concept 5: Hybrid Indexes
