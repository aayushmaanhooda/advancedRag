This is Step 1 of RAG - breaking down loaded documents into smaller pieces for embedding and retrieval.

Types of Chunking Strategies

1. Fixed-Size Chunking (Simplest)
2. Sentence-Based Chunking
3. Recursive Character Splitting (LangChain Default)
4. Semantic Chunking (Advanced!) - Use embeddings to find natural breakpoints based on meaning.
5. Document-Structure-Aware Chunking - Use document structure (headings, sections) as natural boundaries.
6. Sliding Window Chunking - Create overlapping chunks by sliding a window across text.
