This is Step 2 of RAG - converting text chunks into dense vector representations for semantic search.

Embeddings = Converting text into numbers (vectors) that capture semantic meaning


Types of Embedding Models

Model 1: Sentence Transformers (Popular Open-Source)
Model 2: OpenAI Embeddings (Best Quality)
Model 3: Cohere Embeddings
            Unique Feature: Asymmetric Embeddings

            Different embeddings for documents vs queries
            input_type="search_document" for chunks
            input_type="search_query" for user queries
            Better retrieval accuracy!
Model 4: Voyage AI (RAG-Specialized)
Model 5: Multimodal Embeddings (Images + Text)
