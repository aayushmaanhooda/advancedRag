This is Step 4 of RAG - techniques to retrieve the most relevant chunks from your vector store to answer user queries.

Basic Retrieval: Semantic Search
Strategy 1: Top-K Retrieval (Baseline)
Strategy 2: Similarity Threshold - Don't return chunks below a similarity threshold

Advanced Retrieval Strategies
Strategy 3: Hybrid Search (Keyword + Semantic) - Combine sparse (BM25) and dense (vector) search
                                                Combine using RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)

Strategy 4 :Re-ranking (Two-Stage Retrieval) - Retrieve many chunks cheaply, then re-rank with better model:
Strategy 5 :MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) - Avoid returning similar/redundant chunks
