TF-IDF

    TF-IDF answers one question: "How important is this word to this specific document?"
    It balances two competing ideas:

    1. If a word appears frequently in a document, it's probably important to that document
    2. But if that word appears in every document, it's not actually distinctive

    It's measuring ONE word at a time from two perspectives:

    TF: How common is this word within this specific document?
    IDF: How rare is this word across all documents?


HYBRID-search
in hybrid search we combine sparse (keyword-based) and dense (semantic/vector-based) results.

The most common technique is Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), which is database-agnostic and works 
the same way regardless of which vector DB you're using.

RRF_score(doc) = Σ (1 / (k + rank_i))

Example:
Document appears at rank 3 in sparse search and rank 5 in dense search
RRF score = 1/(60+3) + 1/(60+5) = 1/63 + 1/65 ≈ 0.0313

Documents are then re-ranked by their RRF scores.
