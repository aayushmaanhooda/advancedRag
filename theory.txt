TF-IDF

    TF-IDF answers one question: "How important is this word to this specific document?"
    It balances two competing ideas:

    1. If a word appears frequently in a document, it's probably important to that document
    2. But if that word appears in every document, it's not actually distinctive

    It's measuring ONE word at a time from two perspectives:

    TF: How common is this word within this specific document?
    IDF: How rare is this word across all documents?
